# web_scraping_challenge



## Decription

There are two parts to this assignment, which reside in the part1 and part 2 notebooks.  In the first notebook, I am using splinter and beautiful soup to scrape the titles and summaries of all the articles on the page.  I have then stored all those into a list of dictionaries.  

 In part two, I am scraping the table of Mars data from a different site.  That data is stored into a dataframe and analyzed to figure out various measurements for high/low temp and pressure, as well as to estimate the length of a martian year in earth days.  

## Installations

Ensure you have properly installed Beautiful soup and splinter modules for Python
